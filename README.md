# Bike Sale Dashboard Project

This Excel dashboard provides insights into bike sales data through interactive pivot tables and slicers. With this dashboard, users can analyse sales trends, track performance, and make data driven decisions.

- **Slicers:** Slicers provide dynamic filtering capabilities, enabling users to refine their analysis based on specific criteria such as marital status, region, or education.
